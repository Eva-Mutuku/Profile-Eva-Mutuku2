 <h1>Hobbies</h1>
 <ul class="hobbylist">
   <li>Swimming</li>
    <p>If there is a beach or pool nearby and the sun is out, there are high chances that you will find me there. I prefer the beach because I love the feeling of waves picking you up and gently dropping you down, but a pool works fine if there is no beach nearby. I have never swam in a lake and would probably just walk along a river than swim in it. Swimming relaxes my mind as any other workout does.</p>
   <li>Reading</li>
    <p>I am an ardent reader. In fact, I get anxious if I have not read a book in a long while. Any book is a good book for me though I am currently leaning towards biographies.</p>
    <h3>My favorite reads so far are:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Becoming Michelle Obama</li>
      <li>Long Walk to Freedom by Nelson Mandela</li>
      <li>Through My African Eyes by Jeff Koinange</li>
      <li>I'm too Pretty to be Broke and other Lies by Joan Thatiah</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
     <li>Walking</li>
      <p>I get easily overwhelmed and I have found that working-out has helped me a great deal to let go of the steam and walking, mostly, has been my way out. I can walk just about anywhere as long as I have the time and a good pair of walking shoes.</p>
  </ul>
  <div class="Interests">
    <h1>Current Interests</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Small House Living.</li>
          <p>Of late, I have found myself following content that has to do with small house living. I would love to make one for myself someday.</p>
        <li>Minimalist furniture and home decor.</li>
          <p>Like Small house movement, I am intrigued by furniture and home decor that are minimalistic.</p>
        <li>Intentional Living</li>
          <p>This is self-explanatory. I am keen on anything that will help me be more intentional with how I live my life and interact with people.</p>
